# Provider capability is not platform capability

Capability reference; execute through the managed commands documented by this skill. The [official HeyGen OpenAPI](https://developers.heygen.com/openapi/external-api.json) and [Video Agent guide](https://developers.heygen.com/docs/video-agent) were checked on 2026-09-07. The default route requires the Okou release containing the managed Video Agent command; the controlled route uses managed speech and transparent-avatar takes. Personal accounts and connector flows remain outside this Intro Video skill.

## Video Agent and public styles

`POST /v3/video-agents` can author and render a whole video from a brief. Its request fields are `prompt`, `mode`, `avatar_id`, `voice_id`, `style_id`, `brand_kit_id`, `brand_glossary_id`, `orientation`, `files`, `callback_url`, `callback_id`, and `incognito_mode`. Prompt length is 1–10,000 characters; attachments are limited to 20 native media/PDF references. Orientation is landscape or portrait.

Duration, language, narrative, captions, and exclusions are prompt directions, not explicit guaranteed render controls. There is no background, crop, scale, position, or safe-area field, and no general no-avatar/no-voice switch; omitted/null IDs mean automatic selection.

Video Agent always writes and voices narration. Attached MP3/WAV files are reference material; no field makes them the soundtrack, and nothing removes narration or audio from the render. `No voiceover`, `silent`, and `Original audio` are therefore Okou-orchestrated (controlled-route) outcomes. Stripping the audio track from a finished native video is not equivalent: the pacing and captions were composed around narration, and the narrated seconds are still billed. A pasted script is treated as a concept unless the prompt says otherwise; verbatim narration can be requested but not guaranteed, so exact wording plus exact timing is also a controlled-route job.

A completed video also carries `captioned_video_url`, `subtitle_url` (SRT), `thumbnail_url`, and `gif_url` upstream; the managed route currently persists only the MP4.

Presenter composition depends on the look type and on the prompt. HeyGen's own Video Agent guidance treats a `photo_avatar` as a presenter whose environment is generated together with the avatar, while a `studio_avatar` (a preset cutout) and any transparent preview receive only prompt guidance. Observed on the managed route: a transparent studio look renders inside a generated environment with a full head when the prompt is the complete compiled skeleton, and as a cutout with a cropped head when the presenter sentences or the script-mode directive are missing or the prompt is long and scene-by-scene. Output resolution has no parameter on this endpoint and follows the HeyGen account plan: a paid Creator account rendered 1920×1080, a wallet account renders 1280×720 at 25 fps; the "default 1080p" statement in HeyGen's output specifications belongs to `/v3/videos`. Native pricing observed on the managed route was about 42 credits per output second, and a prompt's duration caps are ignored (only the approximate target is followed).

The managed route uses the platform's server-side `HEYGEN_API_KEY`; a personal HeyGen connector token (`HEYGEN_TOKEN`) plays no part in it, so rotating or connecting a personal token does not change managed generation. `brand_kit_id` and `brand_glossary_id` exist upstream but are not passed by the managed route yet, so brand pronunciation is prompt-guided only. When a session fails upstream, the managed status currently exposes `HEYGEN_GENERATION_FAILED` without the provider's failure message; report the identifiers and do not infer a cause. Exact scripts, original pages/frames/audio, avatar placement, and overlay geometry are not guaranteed. `mode: chat` is not a reliable user-review barrier because the agent may proceed to generation.

A public style ID is applied natively on this endpoint. The default route passes the exact selected ID, including a concrete catalog ID chosen by Okou when style selection is delegated. The provider permits omission, but omission does not satisfy the product's Auto-style behavior. In controlled composition, previews can inform permitted added layers; state that adaptation and resolve an explicit native-render requirement if it conflicts with preservation constraints. Do not relabel a style as a Studio template.

Creation returns a session ID and an optional video ID. Track the session until a video is assigned, then retrieve its result. Handle waiting/input, failure, and interruption without duplicate creation. Native session lifecycle and whole-video pricing are distinct from the transparent presenter path. Use the managed artifact result rather than a temporary provider URL.

## Avatar and Studio video

`POST /v3/videos` supports distinct typed inputs. A direct avatar video takes exactly one script/audio source; scripts are capped at 5,000 characters and input speech at 600 seconds. Background-free WebM requires a compatible matting engine. The platform's managed command specifically supplies an audio source to Avatar III and returns a transparent presenter take, not a full authored narrative.

Studio scenes can sequence up to 50 full-frame avatar, image, or video scenes. This is not arbitrary overlapping composition; a picture-in-picture presenter on the same source slide needs a suitable template or an authored composition. Do not mix the old v2 `video_inputs` shape with v3 typed scenes.

## Studio templates

`GET /v3/templates` lists workspace API-ready templates, not the public styles in the form. Native rendering requires inspecting variables and calling `/v3/templates/{template_id}`. V3 text variables use `{"type":"text","content":"..."}` rather than v2 nested properties. Omitted text variables can leave literal placeholders. Layout, avatar removal, and exact voice replacement depend on the variables actually exposed.

This API is not a current managed Intro Video route. If the user supplies a rendered deck/video as a visual source, composition can preserve that material; it is not equivalent to native template-variable rendering.

## Translation and lipsync

`POST /v3/video-translations` translates existing spoken content and uses returned supported language names. It has no general top-level `voice_id`; source-speaker voice preservation and enterprise stock-voice options are not interchangeable with an arbitrary selected public voice.

`POST /v3/lipsyncs` takes existing video plus prepared replacement audio. It does not research, write, or translate the script. A faceless recording does not benefit from mouth-matching; managed translated speech plus local composition can replace its narration. Original-speaker voice preservation and visible-face lip matching cannot be promised by the current managed flow.

## HyperFrames Cloud

`POST /v3/hyperframes/renders` renders a packaged authored HTML project, with explicit fps/format/resolution/ratio controls. It does not create a narrative from a prompt. The platform currently uses local HyperFrames rendering; do not silently invoke cloud rendering or a personal API credential. Local and cloud render flags are not interchangeable.
