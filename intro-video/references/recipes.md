# Recipes: what kind of intro video this is

A recipe fixes the narrative spine, defaults, and production guidance for one intent. The spines reuse the narrative arcs and beat roles of the Okou intro-video template packs ([`Template-artifact/Template-IntroVideo`](https://github.com/vm0-ai/Template-artifact/tree/main/Template-IntroVideo)), so a controlled-route composition and a native HeyGen prompt tell the same story.

Recipes are never shown to the user and the form has no intent selector; classify from the brief.

## Beat vocabulary

Use these roles to structure the script. They are writing tools, not prompt labels.

| Role | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| hook | grab attention in the first sentence |
| claim | the one thing the video says |
| conflict | why now, what is wrong today |
| concept | define the term |
| mechanism | how it works |
| breakdown | the parts |
| example | one concrete case |
| evidence | data, chart, before/after |
| proof | someone else vouches (quote, logo, result) |
| turn | so what changes |
| boundary | when it does not apply |
| recap | the one sentence to remember |
| cta | the next action |
| credits | who is speaking |
| disclosure | required compliance text |

| `explainer` | how something works, tech or process | claim → concept → mechanism → breakdown → example → evidence → boundary → turn → recap (`tec_teardown`) | 60–90 s | landscape | suits voice-over, but a native job still carries a look | motion graphics diagrams; AI-generated for abstractions | term definitions, key numbers | retro-tech, print |
| `report-summary` | deck, report, or data → short briefing | claim → evidence → breakdown → mechanism → example → boundary → turn → recap → disclosure (`con_pyramid` / `fin_report`) | 60–120 s | landscape | suits voice-over, but a native job still carries a look | motion graphics for every figure; attached charts | every number shown, source line, disclosure | print, retro-tech |
| `care-update` | health, patient, or wellbeing information | hook → concept → mechanism → evidence → example → boundary → recap → turn → cta (`hea_care`) | 45–60 s | landscape | on camera, calm | minimal; no dramatization | dosages, contacts, disclosure | handmade, print |
| `social-short` | one idea for Reels / TikTok / Shorts | one continuous thought, hook first | 15–30 s | portrait | direct-to-camera | minimal overlays | at most two short lines | styles whose `aspect_ratio` is 9:16 |

Style tags are preferences for `Let Okou choose`; an explicit style always wins.

A duration band is where a finished video of this kind should land, not a target to pick from — least of all its low end. The number written into the brief comes from the narration actually drafted, converted at the pace in [brief](brief.md); the band only bounds it. A band never reaches the user as a requirement: when no duration was requested, say the inferred length is your inference.

## The narrative frame comes first

Before compiling any prompt, fill the brief's five answers: claim, conflict, turn, proof, ask. Proof must be a checkable fact from the request or a source (a number, a named customer, a file). Waive an answer only with a written reason ("no ask: internal announcement"). A video with an empty frame is a list, and lists produce forgettable output.

## Script rules

These come from HeyGen's own prompting experiments and from the arcs above. They apply to both routes.

- The script is the biggest quality lever. Write for the ear: short sentences, active voice, contractions, one idea per video.
- Write the narration to the target, not to the material. Material always outruns the time available; drop the weakest key messages here, deliberately, instead of letting the agent drop the closing sentence at render time.
- Stories beat lists. First person and a concrete case ("we lost the evening enquiries") beat neutral summaries.
- Front-load the hook. The first sentence carries the claim or the conflict.
- Use the arc as an order, and never as timestamps. Per-scene timestamps make the delivery robotic; that is the one point HeyGen's prompting guide and its own effectiveness research agree on, so they are banned at every length on both routes.
- One flowing narration paragraph is the default at any length. HeyGen documents a scene-by-scene level (a scene type, a visual, and the VO for each) as maximum control for long or data-heavy videos, and it remains available — but this package does not reach for it by default, because our own runs show a long scene-by-scene prompt with per-scene media notes pulling Video Agent back to templates, the cutout, the cropped head, and invented on-screen detail. Order the sentences by the arc and let the production lines carry the visuals. On the controlled route the question does not arise: Okou lays out the timeline, so scene structure is simply the plan.
- Do not build the script around questions to the viewer; a single presenter asking questions reads as unnatural.
- Keep the presenter's words in the narration language and keep every technical directive in English.
- End with the ask in plain words. Put dates, prices, URLs, and names in `on_screen_text` so they render literally.
- Every claim traces to a source. Do not round or invent numbers; if the material does not contain a figure, the script does not either.
