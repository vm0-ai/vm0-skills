# Screen recording: polish the take the user already made

Read this when a video attachment ships a synchronized same-stem `.clicks.json` sidecar — `demo.mp4` with `demo.clicks.json` — and the deliverable is that recording, polished. The sidecar is a real capture artifact, not a hint to interpret: it carries the click timeline the camera work is built from. `okou video camera` renders the whole video locally from the recording plus the sidecar, so this route buys no provider job and no generation credits until narration is added.

This route reframes the recording and changes nothing else. A request to restyle the product story, re-shoot the flow, or narrate a newly authored video is native or controlled work that merely has a recording attached; the recording is then an ordinary video input under [input preparation](input-preparation.md).

## Step 1 — Probe both files before planning

Read `okou video camera --help` for the installed interface; it requires `ffmpeg` and `ffprobe` on PATH. Then probe once and cache:

- the recording: container, duration, dimensions, frame rate, and **whether the audio track carries anything**. A desktop capture often ships a digitally silent track (`volumedetect` reporting about -91 dB). Silence is not `Original audio`: say so before promising the source track;
- the sidecar: `recording` (capture geometry and `content.pixelRect`), `clicks[]` (`tMs`, `frame`, `element.role`), `droppedOutOfFrameClicks`, and `warnings[]`.

`droppedOutOfFrameClicks` is the floor for what any plan can cover: those clicks landed outside the captured content and no framing brings them back.

A desktop capture is usually variable frame rate: `avg_frame_rate` and `r_frame_rate` disagree and the real frame count sits well below duration × nominal fps. Any later frame-index work must put an `fps=` filter ahead of the selection, or indices computed from the timeline address frames the file does not contain and the extraction silently comes up short:

```bash
ffmpeg -i recording.mp4 -vf "fps=30,select='eq(n\,150)+eq(n\,420)'" -vsync 0 frame_%03d.jpg
```

The sidecar carries two different geometries and only one of them is pixel-accurate. `clicks[].frame` is the click position the renderer consumes. `clicks[].element.frame` is accessibility geometry and has been observed tens of pixels off the rendered pixels on a macOS capture, so do not compose against it.

A capture usually also carries the recording tool's own control bar: a contiguous dark band a few tens of pixels tall, present in every frame, belonging to no part of the product. It is not `content` padding and the sidecar does not describe it, so nothing warns you about it — and because the renderer shows the full source frame before the first key, an unguarded plan opens and closes on it. Measure its extent before planning and keep every `rect` clear of it. Identify it by the **longest unbroken run** of dark pixels in a row, not by how many dark pixels the row holds: a bar narrower than a third of the frame is a small fraction of any row, so a percentage threshold reads it as ordinary UI.

## Step 2 — Render the automatic first cut

```bash
okou video camera --file recording.mp4 --events recording.clicks.json --output build/draft.mp4
```

It writes the MP4, an editable `*.camera-plan.json`, a `*.camera-review.json` manifest, and a directory of paired source/output checkpoint JPEGs, then prints their paths with `durationMs`, `cameraShots`, `cameraMoves`, `clicksOutsideFrame`, and `renderMs`. Exactly one of `--events` or `--plan` is accepted. Expect roughly a minute of local render per 20–30 seconds of 1080p-class footage; budget for two or three passes rather than one perfect plan.

Keep this cut. It is the algorithm's own answer, it costs nothing to deliver alongside the refined one, and the comparison is what shows the refinement was worth making. It is also the only render that emits click-moment checkpoint frames: a plan render places checkpoints on move boundaries alone, so this is the only click-level acceptance evidence the renderer produces.

## Step 3 — Review the first cut on frames, not on counts

Open the checkpoint frames named in the review manifest. They are the acceptance evidence: `clicksOutsideFrame` says nothing about whether the clicked control is legible, whether a dialog's edge spills into the page behind it, or whether the payoff frame keeps the text the video exists to show.

Open them in batches. A 3×3 tile of nine output frames scaled to 2560px wide stays legible down to button labels, because the camera move has already magnified them 1.6–2.5×; one look covers a whole pass, where reading them singly costs a round trip each. Unmagnified source frames take a 2×2 at the same width. Reserve a full-size read for the one or two frames the tile shows as wrong.

```bash
ffmpeg -i cp-005-output.jpg -i cp-013-output.jpg -i cp-018-output.jpg \
       -i cp-026-output.jpg -i cp-033-output.jpg -i cp-041-output.jpg \
       -i cp-046-output.jpg -i cp-051-output.jpg -i cp-059-output.jpg \
  -filter_complex "[0:v][1:v][2:v]hstack=3[a];[3:v][4:v][5:v]hstack=3[b];\
[6:v][7:v][8:v]hstack=3[c];[a][b][c]vstack=3,scale=2560:-2" -frames:v 1 tile.jpg
```

Read the manifest's `clicks[].inFrame` against the Step 1 floor: matching `droppedOutOfFrameClicks` is a pass, anything above it is a framing to fix. A click can be flagged while plainly visible — the check wants margin, not mere containment, measured in output pixels, so a click near the top of the frame needs a tighter shot to clear it. The threshold is undocumented and sits near 125 output pixels: aim for about 155, and treat anything under 130 as a framing to fix.

What an automatic plan typically gets wrong: one move per click regardless of how close the clicks are, so the camera never rests; a uniform zoom that crops a dialog or a chip at the exact moment it matters; and a final framing chosen for the last click rather than for the result the viewer should read.

## Step 4 — Edit the plan and re-render

The plan is JSON and rendering it back is the supported loop:

```bash
okou video camera --file recording.mp4 --plan build/final.camera-plan.json --output build/final.mp4 --force
```

Each `shots[].keys[]` entry is one move: it starts at `startMs`, runs for `durationMs`, and lands on `rect`. What the fields mean:

- `rect` is `{x, y, width}` in the source video's pixel space; height follows the source aspect ratio. Zoom is `source.width / rect.width`, so a 1920-wide source framed at `width: 960` is a 2× push.
- `content` can be narrower than the video — a capture may carry padding at one edge. Keep every `rect` inside `content` or the shot shows the padding.
- a move must **land before** its `clickMs`, not on it. A key whose motion is still running when the click fires shows the click mid-pan and reports it out of frame.
- `baseZoom` does **not** do what its name promises: it is inert. The renderer shows the full source frame before the first key whatever it is set to. Give every plan an explicit opening key, or the video opens on the raw capture, recording control bar and all.

`--events` and `--plan` are mutually exclusive, and that has one consequence worth stating plainly: **a plan render carries no click timeline at all.** Its review manifest reports `clicks: []` and `clicksOutsideFrame: 0` — zero out of zero, not zero out of twelve. The field looks exactly like the Step 3 check passing, and it is not a check. Accept a refined plan against computed margins and against output frames sampled at each `clickMs`; never against that number.

Edit for rest, not for coverage: group clicks that share a region under one framing, hold it while the interface responds, and spend the moves on the beats that carry meaning — the choice being made, the state that changed, the final screen. Align each shot's edges to the thing being shown (a dialog's own border, the full chip, the button and its label) so nothing important is half-cut. Re-render, then verify on frames sampled at each `clickMs` rather than on the plan render's own checkpoints, which land on move boundaries and can miss every moment that matters. Tile them and read the tile once. A plan that no longer flags a click can still have introduced a worse composition.

### Solve the plan; do not hand-search it

Every constraint on a framing is stated above and every one of them is computable: inside `content`, clear of the capture overlay, landing before its `clickMs`, and far enough from each edge in output pixels. Search that space with code rather than by reasoning. Each candidate rectangle has to be checked against all four constraints for every click in the beat, and against the pixel columns its edges would fall on; that is arithmetic over thousands of candidates, and doing it a few at a time in prose is both slow and unreliable.

```bash
python3 <SKILL_DIR>/scripts/autoplan.py recording.mp4 recording.clicks.json build/refined.plan.json
```

It detects the capture overlay; groups clicks into beats by time, by screen change and by whether one framing can hold them at all; anchors each beat on the UI block its clicks belong to; picks the framing that clears the margin gate on every click while putting the side edges in empty space; schedules each move to land about 260 ms before its click; and emits explicit opening and closing keys. It prints a per-click margin table, which is the acceptance check the renderer will not give you for a plan render.

Anchor a beat on the **UI block containing its clicks**, found by expanding outward from the click until a band of empty space is crossed. Two anchors look reasonable and are not: the bare click point, which centres the shot on a coordinate and slices whatever sits beside it, and the densest region of the frame, which pulls the shot towards whatever carries the most ink — usually a list or a sidebar rather than the control being clicked. A small control such as a send button forms a block of its own and must be grown into its container first, or the shot anchors on the button and crops the content the click was about.

When a framing reads badly, change a constant (`MARGIN_OUT_PX`, `MAX_ZOOM`, `BEAT_GAP_MS`, `SCENE_DELTA`) and run it again. Tune by constant rather than by editing rectangles: an edited rectangle fixes one shot and carries nothing to the next recording. Several beats pinned at exactly `MARGIN_OUT_PX` mean the margin is the binding constraint rather than the rectangles, and a click pinned against a frame edge caps the margin it can ever reach — those beats fall back to `MARGIN_RELAXED`, still clear of the threshold.

To check an edge the solver chose, or to measure something it does not model, measure; do not estimate by eye. One row of greyscale pixels names every card gap, dialog border and padding edge to the pixel, and a column does the same for top and bottom:

```bash
ffmpeg -ss <t> -i recording.mp4 -frames:v 1 -vf "crop=<width>:1:0:<y>,format=gray" -f rawvideo -
```

Runs of bright values are the gaps between cards and the dialog's own background; runs of dark values are thumbnails and text rows; the first long run of pure black at the right names `content`'s edge and cross-checks the sidecar. Sweep a range of rows rather than probing one, counting non-background pixels per row: the text bands, image bands and the gaps between them fall out of the profile without having to guess which row to read first. Eyes are for judging whether a composition reads, not for reading coordinates off a frame.

## Step 5 — Add audio only if the brief asks for it

The recording's own track is preserved by default. When the user wants narration over it, write the lines against the recording's timeline — the video's length is fixed, so the script is sized to it rather than the other way round.

Generate one clip per line through the managed command in [controlled composition](controlled-video.md), resolving a concrete `voice_id` from [catalogs](catalogs.md) in the brief's language. A run may hold at most **three built-in generations in flight**; more return 429, so batch the lines in threes. Each clip carries a short pad of silence at both ends, so place clips by measured speech onset rather than by file start, and check the placement against the click times before mixing. Mix once, normalize, and leave the video stream untouched — the duration of the delivered file still matches the source recording unless the user asked for an ending hold.

## Step 6 — Accept and deliver

Apply the default technical check in [QA](qa.md): probe the rendered file and confirm the duration still matches the source, the stream decodes, and any added narration is present and at level. A contact sheet across the whole timeline (`fps=2`) is the cheap way to confirm no shot went blank or stalled mid-move.

Deliver the refined cut as the result and the automatic first cut alongside it, each labelled, plus the silent version when narration was added. Report the measured duration and dimensions, and state the recording's native aspect ratio when it is not a standard 16:9 — a screen capture is delivered at its own shape rather than padded or stretched into one. Say plainly which framings you changed and why, and name anything the sidecar could not cover.
