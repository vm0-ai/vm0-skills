# Voice and Talking-Avatar Fast Path

Open this guide only when the video uses generated voiceover or a talking digital human. A talking avatar is generated video with a performed voice and an intrinsic duration, and here it is always a **transparent take**: the composition supplies the background, so an avatar with a baked-in scene cannot be mounted.

## Lock the shared contract first

Before starting external generation, lock one narration beat per scene:

`scene-id | narration text | Router layout id | media: voice|talking-avatar|silent | presenter position | viewer outcome`

The narration text, scene IDs, selected layouts, language, one voice ID, and the set of talking-avatar scenes are shared prerequisites. Resolve the voice once and reuse it across voice-only and talking-avatar scenes. Do not guess final seconds. Do not change the script after dispatch unless the media job is intentionally restarted.

## Run two lanes concurrently

### Media lane

**A talking avatar, from the script.** One managed command produces the take and its narration together, so no separate speech job is needed and nothing waits:

```bash
okou generate avatar-video --provider built-in \
  --avatar-id AVATAR_ID \
  --voice-id VOICE_ID \
  --aspect-ratio landscape \
  --screen-style 3 \
  --no-caption \
  --video-name SCENE_ID \
  --json < narration/SCENE_ID.txt
```

`--screen-style 3` is the transparent WebM with alpha, and it is the only style this route can mount: style `1` bakes a scene behind the person and style `2` returns a green screen that still needs keying. `--no-caption` keeps the provider from burning subtitles over a layout that already carries its own on-screen text. Pipe long or quote-sensitive narration through stdin. Discover identities with `--list-avatars` and `--list-voices`, which take `--avatar-style`, `--avatar-gender`, `--voice-language` and similar filters.

The returned video and its audio are one media result; that scene needs no separate speech synthesis.

**A talking avatar, from an audio file you already have.** Pass it instead of a script — `--audio-url URL` on the same command. The HeyGen presenter renderer is the other route to a transparent take and accepts audio only:

```bash
okou __intro-video-presenter --avatar-id LOOK_ID --avatar-group-id GROUP_ID \
  --audio-url NARRATION_URL --json
```

It returns a landscape transparent WebM and accepts at most 600 seconds of audio per take; split longer narratives at narration boundaries. Because it has no script input, speech must finish before the take can start: that dependency is serial inside the media lane, and it is the reason the script-driven command above is the default. The visual lane runs concurrently either way.

**Voice only, no person on screen.** Synthesize the scene-keyed narration:

```bash
okou __intro-video-voice --voice-id VOICE_ID --text "FINAL_SCRIPT" --json
```

The returned files are already scene segments; keep their ID-keyed durations and word timings. Split only for the command's 5,000-character limit.

**An existing long track.** Keep one source file, voice or avatar, and derive scene boundaries from its transcript or word timings, mounting ranges out of that single source rather than re-encoding a file per scene.

Independent avatar scenes generate concurrently. Parallel submission changes wall time, not the seconds generated; cost rises when content is regenerated or handles and pauses are duplicated.

Physical cutting is a fallback, not the default workflow. Use FFmpeg only when a provider cannot return scene-keyed media, HyperFrames cannot consume the source as a time range, or the requested deliverable explicitly requires standalone segment files.

### Visual lane

Initialize HyperFrames, install the deduplicated Registry items, generate the real scene HTML with provisional windows, and fill its content slots while media generates:

```bash
node <SKILL_DIR>/scripts/bootstrap-project.mjs \
  --project <PROJECT_DIR> \
  --host-id <id> \
  --presenter <off|on> \
  --presenter-scenes <talking-avatar-scene-ids> \
  --media-mode <voice|talking-avatar> \
  --language <tag> \
  --content-font <required-for-first-zh-ja-ko-build> \
  --scenes cover:auto,evidence:auto \
  --layout-map cover=orientation/headline-cover,evidence=data/kpi-grid
```

`auto` creates a six-second authoring window marked `data-vc-timing="provisional"`; it is not a duration estimate. Use `--presenter on` when any talking-avatar scene exists. If scene IDs or layouts are not locked yet, use `--prepare-only` instead and delay scene creation. Never render provisional timing.

## Join once, from real media timing

Measure each returned media file with `ffprobe`; prefer the provider's returned word timings when available. The actual voice or talking-avatar duration wins. Silent scenes retain their planned duration. Add only an intentional bounded pause, never a speculative percentage buffer.

Finalize the existing host and frames with exact seconds; this updates cumulative starts, full-window clip durations, and motion sidecars without rebuilding or overwriting authored scene content:

```bash
node <PROJECT_DIR>/scripts/finalize-timing.mjs \
  --project <PROJECT_DIR> \
  --scenes cover:7.42,evidence:9.18
```

Then replace the marked content slots and attach media:

- Scene-keyed voice files: use one uniquely identified `<audio>` per returned line, grouped as `voiceover` when there are several clips.
- One continuous voice file: mount it once across the host timeline. Scene starts come from its transcript or word timings; do not split or duplicate it.
- Talking avatar: replace the scene's empty `<div class="presenter-media" data-presenter-media="pending">` with a timed `<video class="presenter-media clip" muted playsinline>`, and add a separate uniquely identified `<audio>` using the same source. HyperFrames owns both; never call `play()`, `pause()`, or seek in script.
- Reused long avatar source: set `data-media-start` to that scene's measured source offset and `data-duration` to the scene range. Multiple scene mounts may point at the same source file.
- Never play the avatar video's embedded audio and a duplicate narration track together. The video stays muted; the separate audio element carries sound.
- Put `data-start` on the media or its plain wrapper, not both. Keep the avatar and its audio on the same scene-local window.
- Verify the take before mounting it: it must carry real alpha, not a matte painted onto opaque pixels. A clip that arrives with a baked background was generated at the wrong screen style and is regenerated, not keyed by hand.

Motion is fitted inside the real speech window. The presenter container remains still; the generated performance supplies human movement. Run Preflight only after media is mounted, then continue the normal Static and Preview review.
